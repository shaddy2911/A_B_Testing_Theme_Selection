# Many web platforms and applications perform A/B testing to run experiments to find the best design, layout, or themes for their platform. Instead of relying on assumptions or hunches, applications and websites can test different design variations on real-time users to measure their impact on user behaviour and metrics. By collecting and analyzing data, they can identify which design elements resonate most with users and optimize their offerings accordingly.
